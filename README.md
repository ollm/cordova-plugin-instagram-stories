Instagram Stories Sharing for Cordova
======

## Fork changes
Both Android and iOS now work with latest Meta changes regarding requiring appID

Made to work with Cordova Android v11 and adjusted code to make background and sticker sharing work.
Background image URL is expected to be JPEG

This is a simple plugin that allows to share content to Instagram Stories using Facebook's API Documentation: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram/sharing-to-stories/

    }
  );
